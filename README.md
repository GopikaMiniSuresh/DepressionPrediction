# DEPRESSION PREDICTION BASED ON TWITTER TWEETS USING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING AND MACHINE LEARNING

In today’s virtual world, the social media networks have become a part and parcel in everyone’s daily life that people feel more comfortable in expressing their thoughts and emotions to the outside world using these platforms. Twitter is one of the major social networking platforms widely used by more than half of the population in the world, including both adults and teens. Surprisingly, just as the number of people that uses social media is increasing day-by-day, the trend in depression is also increasing in a daily basis. According to WHO report [1], around 3.8% (280 million people) of the total population is suffering from depression. The worrying factor about depression is that even the affected people would not be able to recognise it during the early stages, thus preventing them from getting any medical help unless the condition has become worse. It is also concerning that people are more worried about their physical health nowadays, that they tend to ignore any mental instabilities that they might encounter.

This repository includes the code for prediction of depression based on twitter tweets using a number of classification methods and feature selection techniques. The analysis was performed on the Mental-Health-Twitter dataset.
